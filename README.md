# Course Repository for "Introduction to Scientific Programming with Python" (UNIL, FGSE, Fall 2022)

See `Tutorials` for the Google Colab notebooks used during the tutorials and `Exercises` for the notebooks used during the coding sessions. If you are taking this course for credits, don't forget to push the completed notebooks in the `Exercises` directory of your cloned repository.

These tutorials and exercises adapt excellent online resources to efficiently introduce the basics of Python, in particular:

There are many excellent tutorials to get started with Python, such as:     
      
- [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) by © Software Carpentry and © Data Carpentry ([License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)), if you need a tutorial that focuses on the fundamentals and goes at a slower pace than this tutorial.
- The [Python Basics](https://energy4climate.pages.in2p3.fr/public/education/machine_learning_for_climate_and_energy/notebooks/1_tutorial_introduction.html) page from [Machine Learning for Climate and Energy](https://energy4climate.pages.in2p3.fr/public/education/machine_learning_for_climate_and_energy/chapters/frontmatter.html) by Bruno Deremble and Alexis Tantet ([License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)). This page is appropriate if you are looking for a quick tutorial covering the libraries to get started with machine learning for the environmental sciences.

If you are struggling with some of the exercises, do not hesitate to:     
    
- Use a direct Internet search, or [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- Ask your neighbor(s), the teacher, or the TA for help
- Debug your program, e.g. by following [this tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/11-debugging/index.html)
- Use assertions, e.g. by following [this tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/10-defensive/index.html)
